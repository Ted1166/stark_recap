# Scarb

Scarb is the Cairo package manager. Scarb downloads your Cairo package's dependencies, 
compiles your projects (either pure Cairo or StarkNet contracts), 
and works as an entry point for other tooling to work with your code, such as Starknet Foundry or IDEs.

Scarb is heavily inspired by Cargo. The goal is to make programmers used to writing Rust feel at home.
